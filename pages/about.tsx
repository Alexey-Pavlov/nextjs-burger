        <p>Fat burgers are good old burgers according to the classic recipe, the right size and for an acceptable
            price</p>
        <p>They are prepared in the American, Mexican and Italian manners, sparing neither the sauce nor the
            filling.</p>
        <p>For those who are pretty hungry, there is an immense &quot;Fattest Burger&quot; with five beef patties, corn chips and
            cheese.</p>

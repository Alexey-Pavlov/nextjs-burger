# Next.js Burger Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) study project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), which covers all the basic concepts of Next.js. 

## Technologies Used
- Next.js
- React.js
- JSON-server
- Typescript
- ESLint

## What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to use the following concepts and technologies in Next.js:

- Dynamic routes
- getStaticPaths
- getStaticProps
- getServerSideProps
- Routing in Next.js
- Some of Next.js components: Link, Image, Head, Layout
- Test database and API with JSON-server
- useRouter hook from Next.js
- Automatic redirect to main page
- 404 page
- Structure component Layout to wrap all pages

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) is used to create a database and simulate loading data from the network.
